I started following a pattern of diet called the <b>"Interminnet Fasting"</b> on 1 September 2017 also 
called as the IF diet, this diet basically is a tool to loose weight. In this diet I fasted for 16 hours
and ate for 8 hours , this resulted to production of HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE , which is the main hormone for
fat mobilisation , growth and is a muscle sparer. I ate healthy worked out 45 minutes weight training and
20 minutes cardio and Ab Excercises and I lost 10kgs in 5 months.

What you eat is What you get inside your body for nutrients , following a healthy diet is a life long process.
For survival and daily activities your body requires a minimum amount of calories and these are obtained from food
, but what if you eat less than maintaince calories  and do this for 3-4 months ? So Do you die BRo?

Well NO ! :D

Your body would use fat as a fuel for survial if you eat less than maintainence calories .
So you will loose weight if you follow a diet plan with a Caloric deficit.

Also if you dont sleep well then you wont give time for recovery to your body and hence will
increase the stress hormone named "cortisol" which will reduce fat loss and muscle growth.
