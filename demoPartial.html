I started following a pattern of diet called the <b>"Interminnet Fasting"</b> on 1 September 2017 also 
called as the IF diet, this diet basically is a tool to loose weight. In this diet I fasted for 16 hours
and ate for 8 hours , this resulted to production of HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE , which is the main hormone for
fat mobilisation , growth and is a muscle sparer. I ate healthy worked out 45 minutes weight training and
20 minutes cardio and Ab Excercises and I lost 10kgs in 5 months.
